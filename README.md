# netflix_Stock_Data
This project scrapes daily stock data for Netflix from a webpage and stores it in a pandas DataFrame.

Features
Extracts data for the following columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume.
Creates a pandas DataFrame to organize the extracted data.
Prints the first few rows of the DataFrame for initial inspection.
Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas library (pip install pandas)
requests library (pip install requests)
beautifulsoup4 library (pip install beautifulsoup4)
Usage
Clone or download this repository.
Install the required libraries using pip install pandas requests beautifulsoup4.
Run the script using python netflix_stock_scraper.py (replace with your actual script name).
The output will display the first few rows of the extracted Netflix stock data.
Note: This script relies on a specific webpage structure and might need adjustments if the HTML structure changes.

How it Works
The script imports necessary libraries (pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup).
It defines a URL pointing to the webpage containing Netflix stock data.
It uses requests to fetch the webpage content and parses it with BeautifulSoup.
It creates an empty pandas DataFrame with the desired columns.
It iterates through each table row (tr) within the webpage's tbody element.
Within each row, it extracts data for individual columns ("Date", "Open", ..., "Volume").
It appends a new row containing the extracted data to the pandas DataFrame.
Finally, the script prints the first few rows of the DataFrame for initial inspection.
